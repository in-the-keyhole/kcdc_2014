Advanced JavaScript Debugging for Agile Developers
This presentation was delivered by Zach Gardner on Friday, May 16, 2014 at 3:20 p.m. at the Kansas City Developer Conference.



Talk Abstract
—————-
In Agile, speed is king. JavaScript is becoming one of the most popular languages for Agile projects. The two seem made for each other, except when new code causes a bug. Traditional JavaScript debugging is slow, and can make velocity nose dive. In this session, Zach will explain techniques he’s taught to Agile teams that made them more efficient when debugging their JavaScript applications. Some techniques can apply to other languages, some are specific to JavaScript.

1. The Validating Assumptions Paradigm
2. Binary Search
3. Top-Down and Bottom-Up
4. Debugger Statements
5. Event Listener Breakpoints
6. Observing Changes – JavaScript Objects and DOM
7. Reporting Bugs
