##Talk Descriptions##
###Grunt 101###
**Mark Determan - Friday, May 16, 2014 at 9:40 a.m.**

In this session we will go over the basics of using grunt task runner to help your JavaScript development process. We will be setting up a basic JavaScript project with the basic task runners. Grunt allows for testing, checking syntax, and many other tasks that will allow you to develop more efficiency.

###Advanced JavaScript Debugging for Agile developers###
**Zach Gardner - Friday, May 16, 2014 at 3:20 p.m.**

In Agile, speed is king. JavaScript is becoming one of the most popular languages for Agile projects. The two seem made for each other, except when new code causes a bug. Traditional JavaScript debugging is slow, and can make velocity nose dive. In this session, Zach will explain techniques he’s taught to Agile teams that made them more efficient when debugging their JavaScript applications. Some techniques can apply to other languages, some are specific to JavaScript.

1. The Validating Assumptions paradigm
2. Binary Search
3. Top-Down and Bottom-Up
4. Debugger Statements
5. Event Listener Breakpoints
6. Observing Changes – JavaScript Objects and DOM
7. Reporting bugs

###Java RESTful End Point Frameworks to Support the Shift to HTML5 SPA###
**Adrienne Gessler- Friday, May 16, 2014 at 9:40 a.m.**

A discussion of the use of Java RESTful End Point Frameworks to support the shift to HTML5 SPA. Browser-based Single Page Applications (SPA) are becoming more prevalent in the enterprise due to increasing mobility requirements and demand for responsive user interfaces. This presents a fundamental shift in application architecture that JEE shops need to be aware of. This presentation discusses the role of Java RESTful End Point Frameworks in that shift.

###JSF in the Modern Age###
**Keith Shakib - Friday, May 16, 2014 at 3:20 p.m.**

With so much focus on HTML5, Single Page Applications (SPA), and JavaScript-based, client-side applications delivering responsive/adaptive designs, you may be asking yourself, Is Java just for server side business processing? This presentation will focus on how to use Java Server Faces version 2 to write server-side user interfaces and, more importantly, why would you want to.
